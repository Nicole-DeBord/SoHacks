Course Materials for SoHacks Class - Introduction To Web Development

***The Goal:*** Expose students to the basics of web development, exposing them to the basic components of a modern web page including [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and other tools and resources to help continue learning more.   By the end of this lesson you will be able to identify the major technologies that make up a website, what each of those technologies does, and the basics of putting together your own website.

#### Overview
Almost every web page on the Internet is built with three technologies HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (JavaScript).  Websites combine HTML, CSS and JS to make up the pages we use every day.  To help better understand how HTML, CSS, and JS make up a web page lets try comparing a web-page to the human body.  

To start our analogy, let start with the bones the body, HyperText Markup Language (HTML).  HTML, like bones, give the web-page structure.  HTML places things like buttons, headings, paragraphs, tables all over the page and the arrangement of the HTML changes the order and placement of elements of the page.

The next piece of our analogy is the skin, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).  CSS gives the the HTML elements their external style and can change the color, shape or many other visible characteristics of the HTML elements on the page.  CSS can control things like fonts, colors, margins, lines, height, width and many other visible elements of a page.

The last part of our analogy is the muscle, JavaScript (JS).  JS makes things move, pop, push all around the page.  It moves the muscles (HTML) and skin (CSS) and can be set to change over time, or to change with input from something like a keyboard button press, or a mouse click.

##### Guided Exercise:
- Download Google Chrome, as a group navigate to the wikipedia page for [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- Right click on the heading that says 'HTML'
- From the drop-down menu, select the option that says 'Inspect Element' 
- A window, the Development Console, should pop up with a lot of random text and special characters and tabs.
- In that new window, look for some text that looks like this:
```
	<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en">HTML</h1>
```
- In that same window, double click on the "HTML" text, the text should highlight in blue, now type in the name of your favorite sports team!
- Congratulations!  You have made your first change to a website!

##### Individual Exercise:
- Go to a popular site like Facebook, and change the words on the page using the Developers Console in Google Chrome
- Look at the individual tabs in the developer console, don't worry if you don't recognize everything, we will talk through more of this later.
