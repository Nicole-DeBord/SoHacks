    <!-- This is the head of the page.  In this area you will put things like links to other files or comments, or even specify settings for the page. -->
    <!-- This is a comment, by the way.  Text that is commented out does not affect the way the page displays and is normally put in the page for information. -->
    <title>This is the title.  Title show up at the top of the tab!</title>

  <body>
  <!-- We are now in the body of the page. -->
  <!-- The body is where we put stuff we want to display on the screen  -->
  <!-- Remember, these are comments.  Comments show up the text editor, but they don't show up on the screen. -->
    <h1>This is a H1 Header!  We are now putting text in the body of the page.</h1>
    <h2>This is a H2 Header!</h2>
    <h3>This is a H3 Header!</h3>
    <h4>This is a H4 Header! As you can see they get smaller and smaller.</h4>

    <p>This is a paragraph. It is used to gather pieces of text that are written as paragraphs. Also you can use <b>tags to make things bold</b>.  You can even make them <i>italicized</i>, or even <b><i>BOTH!</i></b></p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is another paragraph.  The line above is called a horizontal rule or 'hr' tag.  It can be used as a visual separation.</p>

    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>This is an unordered list of items.</li>
        <li>Lists can be used to quickly format a group of items you want to display.</li>
        <li>There are different types of lists.  See what other types you can find.</li>
        <li>The line below is another horizontal rule tag.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <ol>
        <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
        <li>You can use this list to put items on the page with a number.</li>
        <li>Look how it automatically puts the numbers on the page.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>An important thing to note about all of the HTML elements we have put on the page.  In many cases they are structured where you have an opening tag, content in the middle, and a closing tag.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Now that you see how HTML is used to make a skeleton for pages, change this page and make a page about yourself.  On the page you should have the following:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>A paragraph about yourself.</dt> 
      <dd>What is your favorite subject in school, and why?</dd> 
      <dt>A list of things you like to do over the summer.</dt>
      <dd>Try to use one of the list tags we used on this page.</dd>
      <dt>A picture of a pet you would like to have.</dt>
      <dd><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp"></a>Check out this page for hints.</dd>
      <dt>A link to one of your favorite websites (i.e hyperlinks or just links) to your page.</dt>
